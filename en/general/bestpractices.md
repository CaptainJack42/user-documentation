# Best Practices

## Helpful groups

* Group for your own papers: `author=YOURSELF`
* Group for the papers of your group: `author=YOURSELF and author=COLLEAGUE1 and author=COLLEAGUE2`

See [Groups](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/groups.md) for more information on grouping.

## Sort order

Sort your entries with the `bibtexkey` on save \(can be set in the [library properties](../setup/databaseproperties.md)\). This makes finding an entry easier in a large file.

## Use Check Integrity often

Use `Quality -> Check integrity` often to ensure that the quality of your library does not degrade.

See [Check Integrity ](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity.md)for more information.

## Enable save actions

Specify your save actions \(can be set in the [library properties](../setup/databaseproperties.md)\). This ensures that your Bib\(La\)TeX file will look more consistent.

See [Save Actions](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/saveactions.md) for more information.
