# Best Practices

## Helpful groups

* Group for your own papers: `author=YOURSELF`
* Group for the papers of your group: `author=YOURSELF and author=COLLEAGUE1 and author=COLLEAGUE2`

See [Groups](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/groups.md) for more information on grouping.

## Sort order

Sort your entries with the `bibtexkey` on save \(can be set in the database properties\). This makes finding an entry easier in a large file.

## Use Integrity Check often

Use `Quality -> Integrity Check` often to ensure that the quality of your database does not degrade. See [Check Integrity ](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity.md)for more information.

## Enable save actions

Specify your save actions \(can be set in the database properties\). This ensures that your BibTeX file will look more consistent.

See [Save Actions](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/saveactions.md) for more information.
