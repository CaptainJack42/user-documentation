# Medline/PubMed

[MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pmresources.html) is a bibliographic database of life sciences and biomedical information. It includes bibliographic information for articles from academic journals covering medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and health care. MEDLINE also covers much of the literature in biology and biochemistry, as well as fields such as molecular evolution \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE)\).

There are two ways of specifying which entries to download:

1. Enter one or more MEDLINE IDs \(separated by comma/semicolon\) in the text field.
2. Enter a set of names and/or words to search for. You can use the operators _and_ and _or_ and parentheses to refine your search expression. See [OVID operators](https://resourcecenter.ovid.com/site/help/documentation/ospa/en/Content/syntax.htm) for full description.

   Examples:

   * `May \[au\] AND Anderson \[au\]`
   * `Anderson RM \[au\] HIV \[ti\]`
   * `Valleron \[au\] 1988:2000\[dp\] HIV \[ti\]`
   * `Valleron \[au\] AND 1987:2000\[dp\] AND (AIDS \[ti\] OR HIV\[ti\])`
   * `Anderson \[au\] AND Nature \[ta\]`
   * `Population \[ta\]`
